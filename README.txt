Boundary Detection - July 27th, 2022

This program uses image analysis and color thresholding to detect the boundaries between layers of different colored sand. The four colors of sand detected are bright blue, bright turquiose, bright purple, and dark pink. The purpose is to detect changes in the relative position of these sand colors over time as worms burrow through the layers.

INPUT
-images with several layers of colored sand in a thin aquaria

OUTPUT
-thresholded images showing the boundaries between each colored layer
